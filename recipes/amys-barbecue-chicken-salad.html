    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe for barbecue chicken salad is very similar to one at a popular restaurant near my house. 
        I loved it there and decided to make it at home. Now it's one of my favorite salads to make! 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
        </li>
        <li>
            1 head red leaf lettuce, rinsed and torn
        </li>
        <li>
            1 head green leaf lettuce, rinsed and torn
        </li>
        <li>
            1 fresh tomato, chopped
        </li>
        <li>
            1 bunch cilantro, chopped
        </li>
        <li>
            1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
        </li>
        <li>
            1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
        </li>
        <li>
            1 (2.8 ounce) can French fried onions
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup ranch dressing
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup barbecue sauce
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook chicken on the preheated grill until the juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
            Remove from heat, cool, and slice.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, mix lettuces, tomato, cilantro, corn, and black beans. 
            Top with grilled chicken slices and French fried onions.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small bowl, mix ranch dressing and barbecue sauce together. 
            Serve on the side as a dipping sauce or toss with the salad to coat.
        </li>
    </ol>
